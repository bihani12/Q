ITIL, which stands for Information Technology Infrastructure Library, is a framework of best practices for IT service management (ITSM). The ITIL Foundation certification is the entry-level qualification that validates your understanding of the key concepts and principles of ITIL. But why is it so important?

*   **Improved IT Service Delivery:** ITIL provides a structured approach to managing IT services, leading to improved quality, reliability, and efficiency.

The ITIL Foundation certification covers the following key areas:
