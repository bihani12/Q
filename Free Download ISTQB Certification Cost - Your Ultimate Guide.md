## Understanding the ISTQB Certification Landscape

Before diving into the specifics of the costs, let's understand the ISTQB certification landscape. ISTQB offers a tiered certification program, starting with the Foundation Level and progressing to Advanced Levels. Each level has its own set of exams and corresponding costs.

*   **Foundation Level:** This is the entry-level certification and is suitable for testers with little to no experience.
*   **Advanced Level:** This level is designed for experienced testers who want to specialize in specific areas of software testing, such as test management, test automation, or security testing.
*   **Expert Level:** The highest level of certification, designed for seasoned professionals with deep knowledge and expertise in software testing.
