## Why Japanese Massage? A Deep Dive into Healing

Japanese massage, or "anma," is more than just a relaxing spa treatment; it's a therapeutic art form rooted in centuries of tradition. It focuses on manipulating the body's energy channels, known as meridians, to restore balance and harmony. Unlike some Western massage techniques that emphasize deep tissue manipulation, Japanese massage often employs gentle pressure, stretching, and acupressure points to achieve profound relaxation and healing. This course will equip you with the knowledge and practical skills to harness the power of anma.
