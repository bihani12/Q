## Understanding ISO Audits: A Foundation for Success

An ISO audit is a systematic, independent, and documented process for obtaining audit evidence and evaluating it objectively to determine the extent to which audit criteria are fulfilled. In simpler terms, it's a thorough check to ensure an organization is following its own documented procedures and meeting the requirements of a specific ISO standard, such as ISO 9001 (Quality Management), ISO 14001 (Environmental Management), or ISO 27001 (Information Security Management).

**Why are ISO audits so important?**
