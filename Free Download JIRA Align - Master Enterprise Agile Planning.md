## JIRA Align vs. Other Agile Planning Tools

*   **JIRA Software:** JIRA Software is primarily designed for team-level Agile planning.

JIRA Align integrates seamlessly with JIRA Software to provide a complete solution for both team-level and enterprise-level Agile planning.

*   **Azure DevOps:** Azure DevOps offers a range of features for software development, including Agile planning tools. However, like JIRA Software, it is primarily focused on team-level agility. JIRA Align can integrate with Azure DevOps to provide strategic alignment and visibility across multiple teams and projects.

*   **Asana:** Asana is a project management tool that can be used for Agile planning. However, it lacks the enterprise-level features and strategic alignment capabilities of JIRA Align.

*   **Trello:** Trello is a simple and intuitive Kanban board that can be used for managing small projects. However, it is not suitable for managing large, complex projects that require enterprise-level agility.

**Why Choose JIRA Align?**

JIRA Align is the ideal choice for organizations that need to scale Agile beyond the team level and align their development efforts with strategic goals.
