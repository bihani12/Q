The core principles of Lean include identifying value, mapping the value stream, creating flow, establishing pull, and seeking perfection.

**Why seek certification in Lean Manufacturing?**

## Understanding the Lean Manufacturing Certification Cost

The **cost of Lean Manufacturing certification** can vary widely depending on the level of certification, the provider, and the training format. Here's a breakdown of the factors that influence the overall expense:

### 1. Certification Level

### 2. Training Provider

*   **Universities and Colleges:** These institutions offer structured Lean certification programs, often with a higher price point due to their reputation and academic rigor.
*   **Professional Organizations:** Organizations like the American Society for Quality (ASQ) and the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE) offer recognized certifications and training programs.

### 3. Training Format
